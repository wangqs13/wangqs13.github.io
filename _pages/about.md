Since September 2022, I have been a designated assistant professor at the Gruaduate School of Mathematics, Nagoya University, Japan. 

I received my B.Sc. degree and Ph.D. degree from the Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2017 and 2022, respectively, supervised by Prof. Mingsheng Ying.
