Since September 2022, I have been a designated assistant professor (特任助教) at the [Graduate School of Mathematics](https://www.math.nagoya-u.ac.jp/) (大学院多元数理科学研究科), [Nagoya University](https://en.nagoya-u.ac.jp/) (名古屋大学), Japan. I am currently part of the [QLEAP theory group](https://www.math.nagoya-u.ac.jp/~legall/index.html) led by Prof. [François Le Gall](http://www.francoislegall.com/).

I received my B.Sc. degree and Ph.D. degree from the [Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/csen/) (计算机科学与技术系), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) (清华大学), Beijing, China, in 2017 and 2022, respectively, supervised by Prof. [Mingsheng Ying](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/csen/info/1186/4020.htm) (应明生).
